# LLM League Leaderboard Account

The **Leaderboard Account** component of the LLM League platform, responsible for evaluating, ranking, and displaying Large Language Model (LLM) performance using AWS Bedrock as an impartial judge.

## Architecture Overview

![LLM League Architecture](./generated-diagrams/LLMLeagueArchitecture_Updated.png)

The leaderboard account operates as part of a multi-account architecture that ensures fair and secure evaluation of participant models. This account focuses on:

- **Model Evaluation**: Using Amazon Bedrock as an impartial AI judge
- **Ranking Management**: Processing and storing leaderboard rankings via Lambda functions
- **Public Display**: Serving leaderboard results through a web interface
- **Cross-Account Security**: Secure integration with participant accounts

## Leaderboard Account Components

### Web Frontend
- **CloudFront CDN**: Global content delivery for the public leaderboard interface
- **S3 Static Hosting**: React-based web application for displaying rankings and statistics

### API Layer
- **Web API (API Gateway)**: Serves leaderboard data to the frontend application
- **Judge API (API Gateway)**: Receives evaluation requests from participant accounts
- **Leaderboard API (Lambda)**: Central component managing all leaderboard operations, rankings, and data storage

### LLM Judge & Ranking System
- **Judge Orchestrator (Lambda)**: Coordinates the evaluation workflow and manages judge interactions
- **Amazon Bedrock**: AI-powered impartial judge for model evaluation using state-of-the-art LLMs
- **Judge Questions (S3)**: Configurable evaluation criteria, prompts, and scoring rubrics

### Data Storage
- **Leaderboard Results (S3)**: Current rankings, historical data, and detailed evaluation results

## Recent Architecture Updates

### Lambda-Based Data Management (August 2025)
- **Replaced DynamoDB with Leaderboard API Lambda**: Simplified architecture by centralizing all leaderboard operations in a dedicated Lambda function
- **Enhanced Scalability**: Serverless approach provides better cost optimization and automatic scaling
- **Streamlined Data Flow**: Direct integration between Judge Orchestrator and Leaderboard API Lambda for faster updates
- **Improved API Design**: Single Lambda function handles all leaderboard operations (GET, POST, rankings, statistics)

## Features

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### CloudWatch Logs
```bash
# Judge Orchestrator logs
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/judge-orchestrator \
  --start-time $(date -d '1 hour ago' +%s)000

# Leaderboard API logs
aws logs filter-log-events \
  --log-group-name /aws/lambda/leaderboard-api \
  --start-time $(date -d '1 hour ago' +%s)000
```

### Common Issues

**Bedrock Access Denied**
```bash
# Check Bedrock model access
aws bedrock list-foundation-models --region us-east-1

# Enable model access if needed
aws bedrock put-model-invocation-logging-configuration \
  --logging-config destinationConfig='{cloudWatchConfig={logGroupName=bedrock-logs,roleArn=arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT:role/BedrockRole}}'
```

**Cross-Account Permission Issues**
- Verify IAM roles have correct cross-account trust relationships
- Check presigned URL expiration times
- Validate S3 bucket policies for cross-account access

**Lambda Timeout Issues**
- Monitor Lambda duration metrics in CloudWatch
- Increase timeout settings for complex evaluations
- Consider breaking large evaluations into smaller batches

### Performance Metrics
- **Evaluation Latency**: Average time from submission to ranking update
- **Judge Response Time**: Bedrock API response times
- **API Gateway Metrics**: Request count, latency, and error rates
- **Lambda Metrics**: Duration, memory usage, and error rates

## Security

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: All S3 buckets encrypted with AWS KMS
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all API communications
- **Access Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails via CloudTrail
- **Lambda Security**: Function-level IAM roles with least privilege

### Cross-Account Security
- **Presigned URLs**: Time-limited access to participant results
- **IAM Roles**: Cross-account roles with minimal required permissions
- **API Authentication**: Token-based authentication for all endpoints
- **Network Security**: CloudFront WAF protection and DDoS mitigation

## Cost Optimization

### Estimated Monthly Costs (for moderate usage)
- **Lambda Functions**: $5-20 (based on evaluation frequency)
- **API Gateway**: $3-10 (per million requests)
- **S3 Storage**: $1-5 (for results and static assets)
- **CloudFront**: $1-10 (based on traffic)
- **Bedrock**: $10-50 (based on evaluation volume)

### Cost Optimization Tips
- Use S3 Intelligent Tiering for long-term result storage
- Configure CloudFront caching for static assets
- Monitor Lambda memory allocation for optimal performance/cost ratio
- Use Bedrock batch processing for multiple evaluations
